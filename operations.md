## **The Role**
We are looking for a highly organized, technically curious Operations Lead to serve as the connective tissue of our globally distributed startup. This is a "builder" role designed for someone who enjoys creating order out of complexity and ensuring our internal systems scale alongside our growth.

You will act as the primary operational partner for our Operations, Consulting, Sales, and Finance teams. Your mission is to ensure our data is pristine, our documentation is current, and our technical infrastructure—from SaaS licenses to cloud providers—is managed with precision.

## **Key Responsibilities**

### **1. Functional Operations & Support**
* Provide operational backbone for the Consulting practice and Sales team to ensure smooth project delivery and lead management.
* Act as a primary liaison for the Finance Office, assisting with documentation, audit readiness, and vendor management.
* Facilitate clear, asynchronous communication across the company’s primary time zones (**APAC and EMEA**).

### **2. Governance & Data Hygiene**
* **Systems of Record:** Own the integrity of our internal data. You will manage access and permissions for internal stakeholders and approved third-party vendors.
* **Corporate Secretarial Support:** Maintain and organize critical corporate documents, including Certificates of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association (MAAA), and business profiles across various jurisdictions.

### **3. Knowledge Management**
* **Handbook Ownership:** Lead the maintenance of the company handbook, ensuring it remains a "living document" that reflects current policies.
* **Operating Manuals:** Create, update, and oversee auxiliary operating manuals for sub-teams to ensure institutional knowledge is documented and accessible.

### **4. Infrastructure & Tooling**
* **SaaS & AI Management:** Responsible for software license issuance, seat optimization, and service level (SLA) monitoring for our SaaS stack and agentic AI tooling.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Manage administrative access, billing, and basic governance for our cloud providers (eg **AWS and GCP**).

## **Who You Are**
* **A Fast Learner:** You can dive into a new piece of software or a complex legal document and quickly understand its implications for the business.
* **Systems-Oriented:** You naturally look for ways to automate manual tasks and organize messy folders.
* **Technically Conversant:** You don't need to be an engineer, but you are comfortable embracing systematic automation and understanding the logic of modern API-driven tools.
* **An Expert Communicator:** You write clearly and concisely, recognizing that in a remote company, documentation is of primary importance.
* **Global in Mindset:** You are adept at managing your schedule to support colleagues from Tokyo to Dublin and everywhere in between.

## **Qualifications**
* Proven experience in an Operations, RevOps, or Business Admin role within a fast-paced tech environment.
* Experience managing sensitive corporate records, data, and documentation.
* Proficiency with modern project management tools (e.g., JIRA/Plane, Linear, Google Workspace) and cloud billing dashboards.
* Ability to work autonomously and manage multiple high-priority streams of work.
